# Commodity-Data-Normalization
Using Commodity market Data Find the Change in Stock price has a relation ship to the future change in the stock price, I am trying to develop a statistical model

The Normalized Price indicator graphs the price movement of an instrument using 100 as the base value for a user specified base date/time. The normalized value for each bar after the base date/time is the percent of the base price expressed as a whole number. (i.e. 100 times actual price divided by actual base price) This indicator shows the percentage move in price relative to some fixed starting point.
